Developer Extraordinaire
========================
tl;dr
-----
We want **passionate developers** who are smart, get things done, and love developing in **Javascript**, **Python**, and **Google App Engine** (and, of course, can **demonstrate their passion**). We are a small startup in **Kitchener, Ontario**, growing rapidly. Currently, we are only looking for **co-operative education students**.

Who are you?
------------
**You are a hacker.** You get excited to work on tough problems, and coming up with interesting solutions. You're an early adopter; an innovator; you've tried all sorts of different languages and technologies; you're that person who's always tinkering on something. You're not a code monkey: you solve problems. You get things done, you're smart, and doggone it, you like it that way!

**You are passionate.** We might find you on StackOverflow asking and answering questions, hacking away at an open-source project on Github, or writing about software development or something else awesome on your blog. Maybe you're a big fan of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) or Test-Driven Development (TDD) and want the whole world to know, or love talking for hours on the advantages (or disadvantages) of dynamic languages. You get excited about technology.

**You are tenacious.** When you're given a tough problem, you don't let it beat you. When you know something is wrong, you'll work to right it. When life gives you lemons, you don't make lemonade: you make life take the lemons back and demand to see life's manager.

What will you work on?
----------------------
**That's up to you.** There are a variety of projects to work on and wear many hats to wear. You may be working on a recommendation engine to find out a customer's intentions, or a tool to help people find products that they are actually interested in, or even work on open-source tools to make life better for other developers. Regardless, you will work on projects that directly affect the success of the company, and more importantly, you will have a lot of say in how your projects get done.

You will be working with **Javascript**, **Python**, and **Google App Engine**, and there may be other technologies to work with in the near future, but, If you are who we think you are, languages won't matter as much as your skills.

Why you should join us:
-----------------------
**We are small, but growing rapidly.** You'll get into the company early and be like a founder, making important decisions on what features are implemented, how the product is developed, the product architecture, company culture, and more. 

**We care about results, not hours.** We all work different hours, and we want you to set the hours that work best for you. We do try to have core hours of 12pm to 4pm, but we're pretty flexible otherwise.

**We are very sociable.** We regularly play board games (Settlers of Catan, 7 Wonders, Agricola, etc.), play Team Fortress 2, go out for team lunches, and take part in team outings like disc golf or rock climbing; but we're always open to other suggestions.

Who we are:
-----------
We are Willet. We believe that online retailers are helpless, and we are here to make these retailers feel like heroes. We are an early stage startup focusing on converting social browsers into shoppers. We build tools that help customers discover products that are actually interesting to them, and keep them informed about these and similar products.

Where we are:
-------------
Most people call it "Earth", we call it home. Don't panic, it's mostly harmless.

More specifically, we are located in the Velocity garage at the Tannery District in downtown Kitchener, Ontario.

How you can apply:
------------------
We are looking for passionate individuals. If you think you have what it takes to work at Willet, you should get in touch with us with three things: *a reason why we should hire you*, *a copy of your resume*, and *something that shows your passion* including, but not limited toâ€¦
- Github / Bitbucket / etc.
- StackOverflow / StackExchange account
- Portfolio
- Blog
- Website
- An active hacker news, twitter, or reddit account (hopefully /r/programming or the like)

We're more interested in how awesome you are, so please **don't forget to include something that shows your passion**. Once you have that, you can send it to X@Y.com, tweet us (@SomeHandle), or find us if you really want to impress us.
