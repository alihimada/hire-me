User Experience (UX) Extraordinaire
===================================
tl;dr
-----
We want **passionate UX designers** who are smart, get things done, and love designing whether it be in **Adobe Photoshop**, or **HTML and CSS** (and, of course, can **demonstrate their passion**). We are a small startup in **Kitchener, Ontario**, growing rapidly. Currently, we are only looking for **co-operative education students** (who can contact us at co-op@willetinc.com).

Who are you?
------------
**You are a designer.** Things like typography matter to you; you appreciate the difference between Arial, Helvetica, and Calibri. You could go on-and-on about colour theory, white-space, and element arrangement. Your tools of the trade are Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (or the GIMP and Inkscape, if you're a big fan of open-source tech) but your skills aren't limited to just static art. You know that every piece of a web application is part of a potential fluid and beautiful design.

**You care about the user experience.** You know that keeping the user happy is about more than just removing ads from a site or app. It bothers you when you see a form with a million fields, or a checkbox to choose between two options, and you can't stand it when you see happy-text or other bad copywriting. You think about the user's goals, the best way to achieve them, and the best information architecture to present to the user.

**You are passionate.** We might find you on the UX Stack Exchange asking and answering questions, working with an open-source project on Github to make their app really shine, or talking about (or showing off) your design / UX skills on your blog.

What will you work on?
----------------------
**Web applications that revolutionize the online retail industry**. More specifically, you will have the opportunity to work on a variety of different things, from product advertising to application user experience.

You will be working with **Adobe Photoshop**, **Adobe Illustrator**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and maybe a few other technologies in the near future, but, If you are who we think you are, technology won't matter as much as your skills.

Why you should join us:
-----------------------
**We are small, but growing rapidly.** You'll get into the company early and be like a founder, making important decisions on product design, company culture, and more. You'll also have a lasting impact in the design of our promotional materials.

**We care about results, not hours.** We all work different hours, and we want you to set the hours that work best for you. We do try to have core hours of 12pm to 4pm, but we're pretty flexible otherwise.

**We are very sociable.** We regularly play board games (Settlers of Catan, 7 Wonders, Agricola, etc.), play Team Fortress 2, go out for team lunches, and take part in team outings like disc golf or rock climbing; but we're always open to other suggestions.

Who we are:
-----------
We are Willet. We believe that online retailers are helpless, and we are here to make these retailers feel like heroes. More specifically, we are an early stage startup focusing on converting social browsers into shoppers. We build tools that help customers discover products that are actually interesting to them, and keep them informed about these and similar products.

Where we are:
-------------
Most people call it "Earth", we call it home. Don't panic, it's mostly harmless.

More specifically, we are located in the Velocity garage at the Tannery District in downtown Kitchener, Ontario.

How you can apply:
------------------
We are looking for passionate individuals. If you think you have what it takes to work at Willet, you should get in touch with us with three things: *a reason why we should hire you*, *a copy of your resume*, and *something that shows your passion including*, but not limited to...
- Github / Bitbucket / etc.
- StackExchange account
